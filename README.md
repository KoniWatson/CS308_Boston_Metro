# CS308_Boston_Metro
The aim of this exercise is to design and implement a multi-graph ADT (see the link to the MIT multi-graph exercise) and to use the multi-graph to model the Boston Metro System in a program that is able to provide directions to passengers on how to get from one station to another. A key requirement is that both your design and implementation decouples the multi-graph ADT
